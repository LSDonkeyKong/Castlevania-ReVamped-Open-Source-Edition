NEED HELP?
I am aware that I am a really bad coder. In my opinion, if the code works, then it's fine. However, I fully expect people may have questions as to how this game's engine functions and how to use it. Please direct these inquiries to the Dev Corner's #source-code-help channel in the official Castlevania ReVamped Discord server:

This will be the quickest way to get my help!
